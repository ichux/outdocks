# outdocks
These are some docker containers that start up individually, and in series,
as planned that helps when in my localhost during development.

# start-containers.sh
This file starts the containers in the order they are arranged within the file

# stop-containers.sh
This file stops the containers in the order they are arranged within the file

# run the start[stop]-containers shell files
```
. start-containers.sh OR source start-containers.sh
. stop-containers.sh OR source stop-containers.sh
```
