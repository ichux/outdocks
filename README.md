# outdocks
These are some docker containers that start up individually, and in series,
as planned that helps when in my localhost during development.

# run the project
Type `make` while in the project home directory. Then choose from the list that
is displayed e.g. make ui

# if `make bu` fails
If `make bu` fails or any other `make` command that you might run, repeat it again. It should work the 
second time!
